# Orders-Dashboard
The objective is to create a comprehensive visualization dashboard that provides insights into sales performance, profitability, and shipping costs for a retail company. It will identify unprofitable states, allowing users to drill down by year and month, and compare sales and profits for specific school supply products. The dashboard will analyze shipping costs by month and week, present a geographical map summarizing key metrics, and summarize shipping costs by order priority. Additionally, it will highlight the top 30 customers based on sales and allow users to view sales distribution by region, state, and city. Overall, the dashboard aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to enhance decision-making and drive strategic improvements.
